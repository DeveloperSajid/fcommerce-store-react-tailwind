2. **User Details:** A responsive React form collects the customer's Name, Shipping Address, and Contact Number.
3. **Payment Selection:** * *If COD is selected:* The order is placed directly.
   * *If bKash is selected:* Extra input fields appear to securely collect the bKash TrxID and Sender Phone Number.
4. **Data Submission:** The final order object is sent to the backend (Firebase / Express API) and safely stored in the database for the admin to review.
